# Project Title

Analyzing Credit Risk Data With Supervised Machine Learning

__

## Summary
In this challenge, I used supervised machine learning algorithms to analyze and build a model of various loan data via credit risk data. Importantly, credit risk data is inherently imbalanced due to healthy loans out numbering risky loans. Inorder to deal with this imbalance, I used the imbalanced-learn library and data sampling techniques to train and test models in a highly predictive manner.
